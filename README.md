The way it works is as follow:

 - User select a question on a page (eg, google document), press "CTRL + SHIFT + 1" in windows or "CTRL + SHIFT + 1" in mac to store that question. 
 - User press the same combination of keystrokes on answer
 - Repeat until you copy pasta all the questions
 - If you make mistake, you can delete the last question using the popup in topleft of chrome

Finally, using the popup in top left of chrome, you can export all questions and answers to a json file. This json file can be parsed and send into a db for text search later.
